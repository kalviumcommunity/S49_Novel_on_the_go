  "description": "NOVEL TO GO\r List of books to read\r I've got some exciting projects on the horizon, but before I jump in, I want to make sure I'm feeding my brain with good stuff. So, I'm putting together a list of books I'm itching to read pronto. These won't be just any books â€“ they'll be the kind that grab my attention and won't let go. I'm talking about everything from thrilling novels to eye-opening non-fiction. I want to explore different worlds, learn new things, and get inspired by the stories of others. By diving into these books, I know I'll come out the other side with fresh ideas and a renewed sense of creativity to tackle my projects head-on.\r ADITHI",
